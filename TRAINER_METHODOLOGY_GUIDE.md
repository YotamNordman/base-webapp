# Trainer Methodology Guide

## Introduction

The Trainer Methodology feature allows you to create, manage, and apply structured training approaches to your clients' programs. This guide explains how to use this powerful system effectively.

## What is a Training Methodology?

A training methodology is your systematic approach to designing exercise programs. It encompasses:

- How you classify and organize workouts
- Your approach to sets, reps, and rest periods
- How you implement progressive overload
- Your intensity management strategy (e.g., RIR-based training)
- How you structure training blocks and periodization
- Your protocol for measuring client progress

## Creating a Methodology

To create a new methodology:

1. Navigate to the **Methodologies** section
2. Click **Create New Methodology**
3. Fill in the basic information:
   - Name
   - Description 
   - Visibility (public or private)
4. Add components to your methodology:
   - Workout Types (e.g., Push, Pull, Legs, Full Body)
   - Training Styles (e.g., Strength, Hypertrophy, Endurance)
   - Exercise Progressions (e.g., Linear, Double, Undulating)
   - RIR Ranges (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
   - Block Types (e.g., Accumulation, Intensification, Peak)
   - Measuring Protocol (frequency and methods for tracking progress)
5. Click **Save Methodology**

## Components of a Methodology

### Workout Types

Workout types classify different training sessions based on focus:

- **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Push Day")
- **Description**: Detailed explanation
- **Purpose**: Primary training goal
- **Recommended Frequency**: How often to perform (e.g., "1-2x per week")
- **Default Duration**: Typical workout length in minutes
- **Color Code**: For visual organization in the calendar

### Training Styles

Training styles define your approach to sets, reps, and rest periods:

- **Name**: Style name (e.g., "Hypertrophy")
- **Sets Range**: Recommended sets per exercise (e.g., 3-5)
- **Reps Range**: Recommended reps per set (e.g., 8-12)
- **Rest Range**: Recommended rest between sets in seconds (e.g., 60-120)
- **Recommended RIR**: Target Reps In Reserve (e.g., 1-2)

### Exercise Progressions

Progression models define how to implement progressive overload:

- **Name**: Model name (e.g., "Double Progression")
- **Description**: Explanation of the approach
- **Applicable Exercise Types**: Which exercises it works for
- **Progression Strategy**: How to progress (e.g., "Add 2.5kg when hitting top rep range")
- **Deload Strategy**: When and how to implement deloads

### RIR Ranges

RIR (Reps In Reserve) ranges guide training intensity:

- **Name**: Level name (e.g., "Intermediate")
- **Min/Max RIR**: Acceptable range (e.g., 1-3 RIR)
- **Target RIR**: Ideal target (e.g., 2 RIR)
- **Applicable Workout Types**: Which workout types to apply this to

### Block Types

Block types structure your periodization approach:

- **Name**: Block name (e.g., "Hypertrophy Block")
- **Description**: Purpose and approach
- **Recommended Duration**: Length in weeks (e.g., 4-8 weeks)
- **Recommended Frequency**: Workouts per week
- **Preferred Workout Types**: Which workout types to use
- **Volume Range**: Sets per muscle group per week

### Measurement Protocol

Defines your approach to tracking client progress:

- **Weight Frequency**: How often to record weight (e.g., weekly)
- **Measurements Frequency**: How often to take measurements (e.g., monthly)
- **Photos Frequency**: How often to take progress photos
- **Required Measurements**: Which body parts to measure
- **Recommended Photo Angles**: Standard positions for consistency

## Applying a Methodology

Once you've created a methodology, you can apply it to your clients' training:

### To a Training Block:

1. When creating or editing a training block, select your methodology
2. Choose a block type from your methodology
3. Set the duration based on the block type recommendations
4. Create workouts aligned with the methodology's workout types

### To Workouts:

1. When creating a workout, select a workout type from the methodology
2. Apply the appropriate training style based on the client's phase
3. Use the recommended RIR ranges for exercise prescription
4. Follow the set, rep, and rest time guidelines

### To Exercises:

1. Select exercises that align with the workout type
2. Apply the appropriate progression model
3. Set RIR targets based on the client's experience level
4. Track progression history to guide future adjustments

## Using RIR-Based Training

RIR (Reps In Reserve) is a key feature of the methodology system:

1. **Set appropriate RIR targets** based on client experience and workout type
2. **Explain RIR to clients** as the number of additional reps they could have performed
3. **Record actual RIR** to track how closely targets were hit
4. **Adjust weights** based on RIR feedback:
   - If RIR is consistently higher than target, increase weight
   - If RIR is consistently lower than target, decrease weight

## Training Block Periodization

Structure training blocks according to your methodology:

1. **Select a block type** appropriate for the client's current goals
2. **Set the duration** within the recommended range
3. **Follow the frequency guidelines** for workouts per week
4. **Use the preferred workout types** for that block
5. **Apply the volume recommendations** for sets per muscle group
6. **Progress to a different block type** after completion based on goals

## Tracking Client Progress

Use the measurement protocol to consistently track progress:

1. **Schedule tracking sessions** based on the protocol frequencies
2. **Record all required measurements** at each session
3. **Take photos from recommended angles** for visual comparison
4. **Compare results against training history** to evaluate effectiveness
5. **Make methodology adjustments** based on response patterns

## Best Practices

- **Start with templates**: Use the pre-built methodology templates first
- **Customize gradually**: Adapt methodologies based on experience
- **Maintain consistency**: Keep core principles consistent across clients
- **Track effectiveness**: Record which approaches work best for different clients
- **Refine over time**: Update your methodologies as you learn and grow

## Example Application

Sara is a new client with 1 year of training experience looking to build muscle:

1. **Select methodology**: "Hypertrophy-Focused Methodology"
2. **Create training block**: 8-week Hypertrophy Block
3. **Select RIR range**: "Intermediate" (1-3 RIR, target 2)
4. **Choose workout types**: Push, Pull, Legs (2x each per week)
5. **Apply training style**: "Hypertrophy" (3-5 sets, 8-12 reps, 60-120s rest)
6. **Select progression model**: "Double Progression" for most exercises
7. **Implement measurement protocol**: Weight weekly, measurements bi-weekly, photos monthly

The Base application will help guide workout creation and progression according to these parameters.
